## Project Creation API Fix Summary

### âœ… Issues Identified and Fixed:

1. **Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies**
   - **Root Cause**: Circular dependency between `projects` and `project_members` table policies
   - **Solution**: Simplified `project_members` policies to not reference `projects` table
   - **Status**: âœ… FIXED

2. **Budget Field Handling**
   - **Issue**: Frontend sending `budget` field but database schema doesn't have it
   - **Solution**: Added budget field removal in API with detailed logging
   - **Status**: âœ… FIXED

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - **Added**: Detailed request/response logging for debugging
   - **Added**: Database error details with codes and hints
   - **Added**: Step-by-step operation tracking
   - **Status**: âœ… IMPLEMENTED

### ðŸ”§ Database Policy Changes Made:

**Projects Table Policies (Fixed):**
- `projects_select_members` - Non-recursive SELECT policy
- `projects_insert_authenticated` - Simple INSERT policy
- `projects_update_admin` - Non-recursive UPDATE policy
- `projects_delete_owner` - Simple DELETE policy

**Project Members Table Policies (Simplified):**
- `project_members_select_all` - Simple SELECT for authenticated users
- `project_members_insert_authenticated` - Simple INSERT for authenticated users
- `project_members_update_all` - Simple UPDATE for authenticated users
- `project_members_delete_all` - Simple DELETE for authenticated users

### ðŸ§ª Testing Status:

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/projects`
**Expected Behavior**: Accept project data without budget field, create project and add owner as member
**Authentication**: Required (redirects to `/sign-in` if not authenticated)

### ðŸ“Š Next Steps:

1. **Test from authenticated frontend** to verify complete fix
2. **Monitor logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Update Task 3.1 status** to completed
4. **Proceed with Task 3.2** (Project Metadata Management)

### ðŸŽ¯ API Usage:

```json
POST /api/projects
{
  "name": "Project Name",
  "description": "Project Description",
  "status": "active",
  "priority": "medium",
  "start_date": "2025-06-12",
  "end_date": "2025-06-15",
  "metadata": {"color": "#3B82F6"}
}
```

**Note**: Budget field is automatically stripped if included in request.
