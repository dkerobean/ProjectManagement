# Favorites Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
- Favorites were not being shown or persisted properly
- Multiple redundant API calls to `/api/user/preferences`

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Multiple API Calls Issue
- `ProjectsContent` component was calling `loadProjects()` and `loadUserPreferences()` 
- `ProjectsHeader` component was also calling both functions in refresh
- `loadProjects()` already calls `loadUserPreferences()` internally
- This caused excessive API calls (50+ requests seen in logs)

### 2. Favorites Not Persisting Issue
- In `loadProjects()`, `loadUserPreferences()` was called BEFORE projects were set in store
- When `loadUserPreferences()` ran, the projects array was empty, so no favorites could be applied
- Then `set({ projects: transformedProjects })` overwrote any potential favorite status

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Redundant API Calls
- **ProjectsContent.tsx**: Removed separate `loadUserPreferences()` call since `loadProjects()` already calls it
- **ProjectsHeader.tsx**: Removed separate `loadUserPreferences()` call from refresh function

### 2. Fixed Favorites Loading Sequence
- **projectsStore.ts**: Changed order in `loadProjects()`:
  1. First set projects in store: `set({ projects: transformedProjects })`
  2. Then call `loadUserPreferences()` to apply favorite status
  3. Added setTimeout to ensure state update completes before loading preferences

### 3. Added Loading Guards
- Added `isLoadingPreferences` state to prevent concurrent preference API calls
- Added guards in both `loadProjects()` and `loadUserPreferences()` to prevent multiple concurrent requests

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive console logging to track:
  - When functions are called
  - Project counts and favorite status
  - API request/response status
  - Favorite projects being saved/loaded

## Expected Results
1. **No more excessive API calls** - Only one preferences call per page load
2. **Favorites persist correctly** - Projects marked as favorite should remain favorite after page refresh
3. **Better performance** - Reduced server load and faster page loads
4. **Clear debugging** - Console logs will show exactly what's happening with favorites

## Files Modified
- `src/app/(protected-pages)/concepts/projects/_components/ProjectsContent.tsx`
- `src/app/(protected-pages)/concepts/projects/_components/ProjectsHeader.tsx` 
- `src/app/(protected-pages)/concepts/projects/_store/projectsStore.ts`

## Testing
Test by:
1. Mark a project as favorite (star icon)
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify the project still shows as favorite
4. Check browser console - should see debug logs confirming favorites are loaded
5. Check Network tab - should see only one GET request to `/api/user/preferences` per page load
