}

interface ProjectFormData {
    name: string
    description: string
    status: string
    priority: string

}
```

```

#### **API Integration:**
```typescript
// Fetches available team members from /api/projects/scrum-board/members
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchMembers = async () => {
        const response = await fetch('/api/projects/scrum-board/members')
        const data = await response.json()
        const memberOptions = data.allMembers?.map(member => ({
            value: member.id,
            label: member.name,
            img: member.img
        })) || []
        setAvailableMembers(memberOptions)
    }
    if (isOpen) fetchMembers()
}, [isOpen])
```

#### **Form UI Changes:**

const { budget, team_members, ...bodyWithoutBudget } = body

// After project creation, add team members
if (team_members && Array.isArray(team_members) && team_members.length > 0) {
    const memberInserts = team_members
        .filter(memberId => memberId !== session.user.id) // Don't add owner twice
        .map(memberId => ({
            project_id: project.id,
            user_id: memberId,
            role: 'member'
        }))

    await supabase.from('project_members').insert(memberInserts)
