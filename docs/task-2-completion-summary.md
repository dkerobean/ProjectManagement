# Task 2 Implementation Summary: Project Management Core CRUD Operations

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

**Task Description:** Implement comprehensive project creation, reading, updating, and deletion functionality with metadata management and team assignment. Build Next.js API routes for project CRUD operations including POST /api/projects (create with validation), GET /api/projects (list with pagination/filtering), GET /api/projects/[id] (single project), PUT /api/projects/[id] (update), DELETE /api/projects/[id] (soft delete). Implement project metadata handling, team member assignment, and proper authorization checks with search and filtering capabilities.

**Completion Date:** June 9, 2025

## 📋 Implementation Details

### 1. API Routes Implemented

#### `/api/projects` (Main Route)
- **POST**: Create new projects with comprehensive validation
  - Zod schema validation for all fields
  - Date relationship validation (start < end < due)
  - Team member assignment during creation
  - Bearer token authentication
  - Proper error handling with HTTP status codes

- **GET**: List projects with advanced features
  - Pagination (page, limit with max 100)
  - Filtering by status, priority, date ranges
  - Search by name/description
  - Sorting by multiple fields (name, dates, etc.)
  - Owner filtering
  - Comprehensive query parameter validation

#### `/api/projects/[id]` (Individual Project Route)
- **GET**: Retrieve single project with access control
  - User membership verification
  - Complete project data with members
  - Proper 404 handling for non-existent projects

- **PUT**: Update project with validation
  - Partial updates supported
  - Permission checks (owner/admin only)
  - Date relationship validation
  - Empty update protection

- **DELETE**: Soft delete with metadata tracking
  - Permission checks (owner/admin only)
  - Metadata preservation with deletion info
  - Status change to 'inactive'
  - Deletion timestamp and reason tracking

### 2. ProjectService Enhancements

#### New Methods Added:
1. **`softDeleteProject(projectId, userId, reason)`**
   - Proper soft delete with permission checks
   - Metadata tracking for audit trails
   - Status change to inactive

2. **`removeProjectMember(projectId, memberUserId, requesterId)`**
   - Team member removal with authorization
   - Owner protection (cannot remove project owner)
   - Permission validation

3. **`searchUserProjects(userId, searchTerm, status)`**
   - Database-level search with ilike patterns
   - Status filtering integration
   - Optimized query performance

4. **`getProjectStats(projectId, userId)`**
   - Task completion statistics
   - Progress percentage calculation
   - Access control validation

### 3. Validation & Security Features

#### Comprehensive Input Validation:
- **Zod Schemas**: Complete validation for create/update operations
- **Date Validation**: Relationship checks between start/end/due dates
- **Field Constraints**: String lengths, enum values, regex patterns
- **Team Member Validation**: UUID format, role validation

#### Security Implementation:
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Supabase integration
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer permissions
- **Access Control**: Project membership verification
- **Operation Permissions**: CRUD operation authorization
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation preventing injection

### 4. Advanced Features

#### Pagination & Filtering:
- **Smart Pagination**: Configurable page size with limits
- **Multi-Field Filtering**: Status, priority, dates, owner
- **Search Functionality**: Name and description search
- **Sorting Options**: Multiple fields with asc/desc order
- **Metadata Response**: Total counts, page info, has next/prev

#### Error Handling:
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Proper 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500
- **Structured Errors**: Consistent error response format
- **Validation Errors**: Field-specific error messages
- **Authentication Errors**: Clear auth failure messages
- **Authorization Errors**: Permission-specific error details

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js 14+**: App Router with API routes
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and parsing
- **Supabase**: Database operations and authentication
- **TypeScript Support**: Comprehensive type safety
- **Bearer Token Auth**: Secure API authentication

### Database Integration:
- **Supabase Client**: Service role for admin operations
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient data fetching with relations
- **Transaction Support**: Atomic operations for data consistency
- **Error Handling**: Proper database error management

### Code Quality:
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns between routes and services
- **Reusable Helpers**: Common functions for auth and error handling
- **Consistent Patterns**: Standardized API response formats
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation for failed operations

## 📊 Validation Results

**API Route Validation:**
- ✅ `/api/projects` - 2/2 methods (GET, POST)
- ✅ `/api/projects/[id]` - 3/3 methods (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ ProjectService - 9/9 methods implemented

**File Sizes:**
- Main route: 10,021 characters
- ID route: 7,035 characters
- ProjectService: 8,345 characters

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Proper TypeScript support
- ✅ ESLint compliant
- ✅ Consistent code style

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Existing System Integration:
- **Authentication**: Leverages existing NextAuth.js setup
- **Database**: Uses established Supabase configuration
- **UI Components**: Ready for existing component library
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with app error patterns

### API Documentation:
```
POST /api/projects
GET /api/projects?page=1&limit=10&status=active&search=term
GET /api/projects/[id]
PUT /api/projects/[id]
DELETE /api/projects/[id]
```
