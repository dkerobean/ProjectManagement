# Project Overview "Failed to load project data" Error - FIXED

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The "Failed to load project data" error in the project overview has been fixed by addressing the duplicate data fetching issue.

### **🐛 Root Cause:**
The error occurred because:
1. **Duplicate Data Fetching**: Both `ProjectDetails.tsx` (parent) and `ProjectDetailsOverview.tsx` (child) were trying to fetch the same project data independently
2. **API Mismatch**: The parent was still using mock data while the child was trying to fetch real data
3. **Prop Mismatch**: The child component was ignoring the props passed from parent and trying to fetch its own data

### **🔧 Solutions Applied:**

1. **Fixed Parent Component (`ProjectDetails.tsx`)**:
   - ✅ Replaced `mockApiGetProject` with real `apiGetProject` function
   - ✅ Updated to use actual `/api/projects/[id]` endpoint
   - ✅ Proper error handling in SWR

2. **Simplified Child Component (`ProjectDetailsOverview.tsx`)**:
   - ✅ Removed duplicate data fetching logic
   - ✅ Now uses props passed from parent component
   - ✅ Cleaned up unused imports and types
   - ✅ Eliminated loading states and error handling (handled by parent)

3. **Data Flow Structure**:
   ```
   ProjectDetails (parent)
   ├── Fetches data via SWR + real API
   ├── Passes data as props
   └── ProjectDetailsOverview (child)
       └── Uses props data directly
   ```

### **📊 Data Mapping:**
- **Project Name**: From `client.clientName` prop
- **Description**: From `content` prop
- **Status**: From `schedule.status` prop
- **Progress**: From `schedule.completion` prop
- **Dates**: From `schedule.startDate/dueDate` props
- **Team Members**: From `client.projectManager/skateHolder` props

### **🎯 Result:**
- ✅ No more "Failed to load project data" error
- ✅ Project overview displays properly with real data
- ✅ Eliminated duplicate API calls
- ✅ Improved performance (single API call instead of two)
- ✅ Cleaner component architecture
- ✅ Proper error handling at parent level

The project overview now works correctly and displays project information using the data fetched by the parent component!
