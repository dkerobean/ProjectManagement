# Icon Import Error Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

Fixed the import error in `CreateEventDialog.tsx` where `LuPalmtree` was being imported from `react-icons/lu` but this icon doesn't exist in the library.

### **🔧 Problem:**
```typescript
// ❌ This icon doesn't exist
import { LuPalmtree } from 'react-icons/lu'
```

### **✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// ✅ Using existing Tabler icon instead
import {
    // ...existing imports...
    TbTree,
} from 'react-icons/tb'
```

### **📝 Changes Made:**

1. **Removed Invalid Import:**
   - Removed `import { LuPalmtree } from 'react-icons/lu'`

2. **Added Valid Icon:**
   - Added `TbTree` to the existing `react-icons/tb` import list

3. **Updated Usage:**
   - Changed `icon: <LuPalmtree />` to `icon: <TbTree />`

### **🎯 Result:**
- ✅ Build errors resolved
- ✅ Application compiles successfully
- ✅ Tree icon functionality maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes to UI

The `TbTree` icon from Tabler Icons provides a similar visual representation while being a valid import from the `react-icons/tb` library that was already being used in the component.
